            <h2><a href="https://bibleproject.com/bible/nasb/genesis/3/">Genesis 3:1-7</a></h2>
            <p>
                The snake is a creature that is observant, strategic, and can make decisions towards an advantage. 
                This can be used for both good (tov) and bad (ra') ends. The Hebrew word shrewd ('arum) is a morally neutral term.
            </p>
            <p>
                God wants the humans in the garden to rule and grow in wisdom. But the question is: by what means will they gain wisdom? 
                Will they take it for themselves or allow God to give it to them?
            </p>
            <p>
                After close reading and rereading, we are meant to see the snake in the garden as a spiritual being in disguise. He is 
                deceiving and failing through the abuse of his wisdom and God-given place in creation. The humans follow suit.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://bibleproject.com/bible/nasb/genesis/3/">Genesis 3:8-19</a></h2>
            <p>
                Gen. 3:16 refers to the agony, hardship, worry, and anxiety of the circumstances in which children are conceived, 
                born and raised, and in which they die.
            </p>
            <p>
                The description of the consequences for both the woman and the man are marked with the same emotional pain. 
                For each, their realm of life-giving productivity is marked by grief.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than punishments, Genesis 3:16-19 names the new normal in light of the humans' decisions. Yahweh will use this 
                new environment to test the faith of his people, so they come to see he is the one who gives them life—not their schemes 
                to produce children or the fruit of the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Bible portrays divine judgment with God saying, “I will bring judgment.” But when it describes how this actually occurs, 
                judgement consistently comes through the consequences of people's decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In verse 16, the context, the word choice, and the hyperlinks to these words, "desire" and "rule," all seem to describe what it looks 
                like when a husband and wife define what is good in their own eyes, causing their wills to be in conflict with each other.
            </p>

            <h2><a href="https://bibleproject.com/bible/nasb/genesis/3/">Genesis 3:20-24</a></h2>
            <p>
                The provision of clothing for the humans in Genesis 3:21 is a mercy moment. It presents the complex portrait of a God who does not 
                condone poor action but continues to work with people in non-ideal situations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The last line of the exile from Eden, with the cherubim guarding the entrance, becomes a key to understand 
                he Eden pattern in the rest of the story.
