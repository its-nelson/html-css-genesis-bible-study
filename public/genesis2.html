        <h1>Genesis <span>2</span></h1>
        <div class="left-card">
            <h2><a href="https://bibleproject.com/bible/nasb/genesis/2/">Genesis 2:1-3</a></h2> 
            <p>
                God resting in his creation is him filling it with his presence.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://bibleproject.com/bible/nasb/genesis/2/">Genesis 2:4</a></h2>
            <p>
                4a These are the generations (Toledot) of the skies and the land,
            </p>
            <p>
                Toledot (תולדת) is related to the Hebrew word "to give birth".
            </p>
            <p>
                Genesis 2:4a acts as a hinge point between Genesis 1 which is the <strong>ideal</strong> and Genesis 2:4b onwards which 
                is the <strong>reality</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Genesis 1 gives you the global picture of the cosmic snow globe where God and humans are one. 
                Genesis 2 then zooms in on a family chosen to be representatives on behalf of all humanity and become God's 
                vehicle to bring blessing to the many.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://bibleproject.com/bible/nasb/genesis/2/">Genesis 2:5-6</a></h2>
            <p>
                These verses are like an aside and the narrative picks up from verse 7. They also evoke the image of a desolate wilderness
                mirroring Genesis 1:2 ("The land was wild and waste.")
            </p>
            <p>
                In verse 6, the stream (mist) of water is a source of life in the dry land that makes 
                human life and garden life possible.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="right-card">
            <h2><a href="https://bibleproject.com/bible/nasb/genesis/2/">Genesis 2:7-17</a></h2>
            <p>
                In verse 7, God forming the human of the dust signifies his mortal state.
            </p>
            <p>
                In verse 10, one river flows from Eden and then separates into four heads each passing through Canaan, Egypt, Assyria, and 
                Babylon which are the four regions where the entire Biblical drama takes place.
            </p>
            <p>
                In verse 15, the human is rested in the place of divine refuge i.e. the garden.
            </p>
            <h2><a href="https://bibleproject.com/bible/nasb/genesis/2/">Genesis 2:18-24</a></h2>
            <p>
                In verse 18, the word "helper" can be referred to as a deliverer .
            </p>
            <p>
                In verse 21, the word "rib" actually means side.
            </p>
            <p>
                God makes one who can deliver the lone human from his inability to fulfill the divine commission alone.
