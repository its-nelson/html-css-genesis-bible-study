            <p>
                A more helpful English word for “earth” in the case of Genesis 1:1 is “land”, 
                and a more helpful word for “heavens” is “skies”.
            </p>
            <p>
                This verse is like a heading. The story narrative sequence actually begins in verse 2.
            </p>
            <a href="https://bibleproject.com/bible/nasb/genesis/1/"><h2>Genesis 1:2-5</h2></a>
            <p>
                Now, the land was wild and waste (tohu va-vohu / תהו ובהו) and darkness was over 
                the face of the deep abyss (tehom / תהום) but the breath of Elohim (invisible energy) 
                was hovering over the face of the waters (hamayim / המים).
            </p>
            <p>
                When the ruakh (Spirit) of Elohim is present, the abysmal disorder is neutralized and can 
                become a vehicle of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                The creation of light and its separation from darkness generates the fundamental 
                order of time that governs the rest of the chapter—day and night.
            </p>

        <div class="right-card">
            <a href="https://bibleproject.com/bible/nasb/genesis/1/"><h2>Genesis 1:6-31</h2></a>

            <p>
                <strong>Literary origami:</strong> Genesis 1 could be folded along two axes. When you fold it along the 
                triads (Day 1-3 along Days 4-6), you get order and inhabitants.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you fold it on a vertical axis, you get heaven and earth. Days 1 and 4 are heaven, 
                Days 2 and 5 are the in-between, Days 3 and 6 deal with the land.
            </p>
            <p>
                A creature that is one and simultaneously more than one is an integral part of what it 
                means to be the image of God (Genesis 1:27).
            </p>
            <p>
                Genesis 1 gives us the ideal portrait of God's creation.
